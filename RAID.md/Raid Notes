Creating a Raid In Linx

1. Create new drives for AWS instance 
  a. Go to 'Volumes' under 'Elastic Block Store' and hit 'Create Volume'. NOTE: MAKE SURE NEW DRIVE IS IN THE SAME AVAILABILITY ZONE
  b. Once drives are done initalizing, attach them the instance for this class. 
2. SSH into the AWS server and type 'lsblk' this will show your new drives
3. sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/xvdb /dev/xvdc /dev/xvdd
  a. Named the raid md0
4. The command 'cat /proc/mdstat' allows me to see the process of the array building as it uses a recovery process to build the array for preformance reasons. 
5. Create and mount the filesystem with the following lines
  a. sudo mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/md0
  b. sudo mkdir -p /mnt/md0
  c. sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/md0
  d. df -h -x devtmpfs -x tmpfs
6. Use 'cat /proc/mdstat' again to see if it has completed the array build.
7. Scan the raid and append the file with 'sudo mdadm --detail --scan | sudo tee -a /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf' 
8. The command 'sudo update-initramfs -u' will allow the raid to be available during early boot up by modifying the RAM file system. 
9. The command 'echo '/dev/md0 /mnt/md0 ext4 defaults,nofail,discard 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab' will automatically mount the raid array during system boot. 
10. The command 'mdadm --detail /dev/md0' will show the RAID status with mdadm. This shows that our raid 5 is mounted and managed.

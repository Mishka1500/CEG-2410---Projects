### _2FA and You_

Two areas of my life where 2FA is used include Wright State University and Steam.

Wright State University
   * _For Wright State University, I can authenticate myself with text messages or through an authenticator app called Duo Mobile. Both provide a one-time code that allows me access to my account._

Steam
   * _For Steam, I only have one way of authenticating myself and that is through Steam's mobile app which has a built-in authenticator called Steam Guard. Steam Guard works just like any other authenticator app but was built by Steam itself and provides a one-time code that lasts for 30 seconds before a new code is provided._

### _2FA on Discord_

To enable 2FA on Discord, navigate to your profile settings and click "enable 2FA". From here Discord will ask for your password and then it will create a pop-up screen that tells you to install either Authy or Google Authenticator for the authentication app. After one of those apps is installed, scan the QR code that is provided. Once you have scanned the code, input the 6-digit code from your authenticator app into that pop-up screen in Discord and hit "activate". You now have 2FA activated on Discord which helps add more security to your discord account.

### _King for a Day_

If I could pick what everyone uses for 2FA I would pick an authentication code through an authenticator app. Using 2FA with an authenticator app not only provides more security to your account but is also relatively easy to set up. Using an authenticator app also allows your account codes to expire within a set amount of time which is handy if someone happens to view your authentication codes. Overall I think authentication codes are safer and more secure that some of the other forms of 2FA.
